<h1>Chapter 2</h1>

<p>
    Both Ben and the shepard were finally fed, Ben was sprawled out by the fire and the shepard was lazilly laying on his bed with a book in his hands. The house was traquil and calm as the fire lightly crackled and cracked the the wood burning within.
</p>
<p>
    the tranquil atmosphere was suddenly interupted as a sudden gust of wind throws the front door open, almost knocking it off its hinges as it crashes into the inner wall. Ben quickly hops onto his paws and runs to the shepard.
</p>

<p>
    "a storm?"
</p>

<p>
    the shepard says with a confused tone as he gets up to have a look outside the door into the black night. hes unable to see a thing as the clouds have blocked the moonlight, he can hear the howls of the strong winds against the landscape. A blinding flash almost stuns the shepard, he steps back quickly before he ears are left ringing from the deep crash of thunder.
