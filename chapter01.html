<H1>Chapter 1</H1>

<p>
    It’s a still spring evening in the west of Ireland, a Shepard and his dog look over their flock of sheep one last time before heading back to their cottage.
</p>
<p>
    
    "C'mon boy, it’s getting late"
</p>
<p>
    The Shepard says to his dog as he turns and heads towards the small thatch roofed cottage just visible in the distance. The Shepard’s dog was simply named 'Ben'. Ben was a black and white border collie, bred for herding and protecting sheep. Ben wasn’t very well groomed but always seemed content and more than happy to obey the shepherd’s commands.

<p>
    The Shepard and Ben eventually make it to the door of their home. The Shepard scrapes off the thick mud from his boots before pushing against the heavy solid wood door and entering. Ben follows swiftly behind, running past the Shepard to lay down in front of the open fireplace. Embers from the previous night’s fire still emit enough heat to please Ben, but it won’t last them the cold night ahead. the Shepard fixes this as he heaves a large dry log into the fire to keep it from dying.

<p>
    The silence of the cottage was interrupted by the growling sound of the shepherd’s stomach. Neither Ben nor the Shepard have eaten since the early morning. 
    Both the Shepard and Ben look towards each other
</p>
<p>
    "I agree, time to get us both fed" 
</p>
<p>
    With that being said, the Shepard turns around and grunts as he bends over to rummage in the cupboard, soon returning with two tins, one dog food and the other chicken soup. The moment the two tins clink together Ben raises he ears and begins wagging his tail. The shepherd’s routine was very predictable even for a dog, ben knew he was about to have a good meal.
