<H1>Chapter 1</H1>

<p>
    Its a still spring evening in the west of ireland, a shepard and his dog look over their flock of sheep one last time before heading back to their cottage.
</p>
<p>
    
    "C'mon boy, its getting late"
</p>
<p>
    The shepard says to his dog as he turns and heads towardss the small thatch roofed cottage just visible in the distance. The shepards dog was simply named 'Ben'. Ben was a black and white border collie, bred for hearding and protecting sheep. Ben wasnt very well groomed but always seemed content and more then happy to obey the shepards commands.
