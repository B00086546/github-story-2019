<H1>Chapter 1</H1>

<p>
    Its a still spring evening in the west of ireland, a shepard and his dog look over their flock of sheep one last time before heading back to their cottage.
</p>
<p>
    
    "C'mon boy, its getting late"
</p>
<p>
    The shepard says to his dog as he turns and heads towardss the small thatch roofed cottage just visible in the distance. The shepards dog was simply named 'Ben'. Ben was a black and white border collie, bred for hearding and protecting sheep. Ben wasnt very well groomed but always seemed content and more then happy to obey the shepards commands.
</p>
<p>
    The shepard and Ben eventually make it to the door of their home. The shepard scrapes off the thick mud from his boots before pushing against the heavy solid wood door and entering. Ben follows swiftly behind, running past the shepard to lay down infront of the open fireplace. Embers from the previous nights fire still emit enough heat to please Ben, but it wont last them the cold night ahead. the shepard fixes this as he heaves a large dry log into the fire to keep it from dying.
</p>

<p>
    The silience of the cottage was interupted by the growling sound of the shepards stomach. Neither Ben nor the shepard have eaten since the early morning. 
    Both the shepard and Ben look towards eachother
</p>
<p>
    "I agree, time to get us both fed" 
</p>
