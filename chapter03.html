<h1>Chapter 3</h1>

    The cottage continued to rattle through the night as the gale force winds push and shove against the walls and roof wiht incredible speed.

    Morning finally came, the cottage was quiet and both Ben and the shepherd were resting peacfully. The wind has died down almost completely now, the morning sun rays spill throgh the cracks in the door. Ben begins his morning ritual of stretching his back, putting his front paws forward like someone performing yoga before curling back into a ball laying infront of the almost dead fire.

    Once the shepherd awakes, he throws off his blanket and his feet land into his heavy leather boots. With his laces tied he stands up to grab a slice of bread before wetting his face in a basin of water.

    "C'mon boy, we'll have a lot to do today."

    Ben hops to his feet and awaits impatiently at the door, trotting back and forth itching to get outside. The shepherd eventually walks up to the door and heaves it open revealing the aftermath of last nights reckless storm.

    "My lord..."
