# Chapter 3

    The cottage continued to rattle through the night as the gale force winds push and shove against the walls and roof with incredible speed. 

    Morning finally came, the cottage was quiet and both Ben and the shepherd were resting peacefully. The wind has died down almost completely now, the morning sun rays spill through the cracks in the door. Ben begins his morning ritual of stretching his back, putting his front paws forward like someone performing yoga before curling back into a ball laying in front of the almost dead fire.

    Once the shepherd awakes, he throws off his blanket and his feet land into his heavy leather boots. With his laces tied he stands up to grab a slice of bread before wetting his face in a basin of water.

    "C'mon boy, we'll have a lot to do today."

    Ben hops to his feet and awaits impatiently at the door, trotting back and forth itching to get outside. The shepherd eventually walks up to the door and heaves it open revealing the aftermath of last night’s reckless storm.

    "My lord..."

    The shepherd is welcomed with the sight of a barren landscape, branches and uprooted trees are scattered like confetti across the meadows in front of mine. with a whistle and a hand signal to Ben he sends his dog out to search for any sign of the herd. Ben searches and sniffs around for what seems like an eternity before he finds any sign of the sheep. a small tuff of fur stuck to a branch outside the entrance to a small cave like structure. Ben quickly begins barking for the shepherd’s attention.

    The shepherd finally arrives and catches his breath before peering into the deep dark cave. he takes a few steps inside and with a sigh of relieve he finds the entire herd of sheep with their lambs, seemingly unharmed, and all bundled into a corner together.

    "Thank Christ. Let's get you back to the cottage, that crazy spring storm is over."
