<h1>Chapter 2</h1>

<p>
    Both Ben and the shepherd were finally fed, Ben was sprawled out by the fire and the shepherd was lazily laying on his bed with a book in his hands. The house was tranquil and calm as the fire lightly crackled and cracked the wood burning within.
</p>
<p>
    The tranquil atmosphere was suddenly interrupted as a sudden gust of wind throws the front door open, almost knocking it off its hinges as it crashes into the inner wall. Ben quickly hops onto his paws and runs to the shepherd.
</p>

<p>
    "a storm?"
</p>

<p>
    The shepherd says with a confused tone as he gets up to have a look outside the door into the black night. he’s unable to see a thing as the clouds have blocked the moonlight, he can hear the howls of the strong winds against the landscape. A blinding flash almost stuns the shepherd, he steps back quickly before he ears are left ringing from the deep crash of thunder.
</p>

<p>
    He steps back inside and heaves the door closed against the constant pushing of the stormy winds. with the door finally closed he, this time, securely locks the latch to keep the door closed. He lets out a relieved sigh before turning to Ben who was now hiding beneath the shepherd’s bed.
</p>

<p>
    "It's already boy, you can come out now"
</p>

<p>
    The shepherd says as he coaxes Ben out from under the bed. he sits back onto his bed and looks towards the door with a worried look upon his face.
</p>

<p>
    "I've never seen such a fierce storm so early in Spring before"
</p>

<p>
    He looks to ben who’s now sitting beneath him, wagging his tail and looking up at him
</p>

<p>
    "Let’s just hope the sheep make it through the night, they always seem to find some shelter"
</p>

<p>
    The shepherd gives Ben a few pats on his head before he rolls over in his bed, wanting to get some sleep before waking up early to check on the sheep.
